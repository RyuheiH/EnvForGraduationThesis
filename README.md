# EnvForGraduationThesis

This is an environment for my graduation thesis, which is about Personal Sound and its effect on communication within automobiles.
Personal Sound is a small sound field, made by speaker arrays or parametric speakers, which allows people to listen to music and contents alone without using headphones.
This experiment was about testing if Personal Sound improves the communication in viehcles. My thesis abstract is found down below.

The source code is in the "codes" folder, where you can find 5 Python files. PS_exp.py is a program that tracks the head movement of participants in the experiment and mimics the Personal Sound Field. The head tracking works by using OpenCV and Aruco.

Voice_analysis.py uses a library called Librosa to analyze the pitch and volume of the voice, which determines the Lombard Effect.
